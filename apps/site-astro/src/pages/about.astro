        <p>
          I am a seasoned technical lead and developer advocate with a passion
          for empowering developers and driving exceptional developer
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong background in full stack engineering and expertise in
          front-end development, I have led successful projects, mentored teams,
          and delivered innovative solutions for renowned brands.
        </p>

        <p>
          I build the <a href={getUrlForSanityType("project", "space-madness")}
            >Space Madness stack</a
          > to leverage some amazing tech and stitch together ideas in a bidirectionally
          linked content map. It powers this site, as well as <a
            href={getUrlForSanityType("project", "poly-love-life")}
            >Poly Love Life</a
          > where I write educational content about polyamory.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working, I dabble in the dark arts of creative writing,
          Olympic weightlifting, and exploring the majestic PNW.
